# Horizontal Pod Autoscaler on Kubernetes example with Prometheus and Spring Boot

This is an example about how works Horizontal Pod Autoscaler on Kubernetes with custom metrics using Spring Boot
Actuator with Prometheus.

If you want more information about this example you can take a look in:

* English: https://refactorizando.com/en/autoscaling-with-prometheus-and-spring-boot-in-kubernetes/

## How does it work?

First, deploy a Prometheus instance to your Kubernetes cluster, so you can do it with Helm Chart with the following command:

    helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
    helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
    helm repo update
    helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus

After that verify if your Prometheus-Server is working correctly in the port 9090

    kubectl port-forward prometheus-server 9090:9090

If everything works fine, you need to implement an adapter to use Prometheus with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler,
This adapter is a bridge between custom metrics and Prometheus. East
The adapter was created to collect metrics for "http_server_requests_seconds_count_sum"
To deploy this adapter, go to the Kubernetes folder and run:

    helm install -f helm-prometheus.yaml prometheus-adapter prometheus-community/prometheus-adapter

With Prometheus and adapter working let's go to continue with the Spring Boot application:
First build a docker image with the next command:

    mvn install
    mvn spring-boot:build-image

After that and if your are working in your local don't forget:

    eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)

And go into kubernetes folder and run the next command:

     kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

Finally you can run your Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and verify with:

     kubectl apply -f HorizontalPodAutoscaler.yaml.

## How can I verify is HPA create new replicas?

This example will create new replicas when your Spring Boot application
it has more than 10 requests, so a new replica will be created at that time.
the maximum number of pods to be created in our example is 5, you can change
that value in this maxReplicas property.
